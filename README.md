# HelpfulAudioChopper
Python application to split up an audio file and name the parts.

Originally made to split up [this audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOlDL3_MYnI) of 500+ sound effects, but built with reusability in mind.

### Planned Features

- Change silence settings on the fly w/ menu
- Fast renaming workflow
  - Optionally input text file with names and monitor
  - Or manually enter each with audio preview
- More user friendly application
  - Maybe switch away from tkinter & potentially python too
  - Compile code into an .exe file or similar that opens a normal program window
